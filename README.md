# MTSA
Metabolic Thermodynamic Sensitivity Analysis (MTSA) is a novel computational framework designed to explore the thermodynamic and metabolic properties of complex biological systems. By integrating thermodynamic principles with constraint-based modeling, MTSA identifies key reactions and metabolites that drive metabolic fluxes under varying physiological conditions. The method begins with the estimation of physiologically relevant metabolite concentrations using Max/Min Driving Force (MDF) analysis, which assumes that all reactions operate at maximum thermodynamic driving force. This involves parsing reaction formulas, identifying reactants and products, and optimizing metabolite concentrations within physiologically relevant ranges (1 μM to 10 mM). The MDF analysis maximizes the minimum driving force across all reactions while ensuring thermodynamic feasibility based on Gibbs free energy values (ΔG°) and temperature-dependent terms. The resulting metabolite concentrations provide reference points for subsequent kinetic parameter estimation, allowing for a deeper understanding of metabolic network behavior.
